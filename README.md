# smartHAuS Docs

This is a collection of documentation and files from our Senior Project 'smartHAuS' - an intelligent H.ome Au.tomation S.ystem

Documentation has been translated into github's .md format for easy reference.


The [Initial Design](docs/smartHAuS_initial-design.md) is the original proposal for my project.

The [Formal Design](docs/smartHAuS_formal-design.md) details functional and non-functional requirements.

The [Final Design](docs/smartHAuS_final-design.md) covers an overview of system architecture for the various components.

The [Device Ideas List](docs/smartHAuS_device-ideas.md) is a collection of potential devices the system intended to support.

The [User Manual/Guide](docs/smartHAuS_user-guide.md) discusses implementation details, reviews the icanHAS protocol, and illustrates the device on-boarding procedure.

And lastly I've included the [Budget Breakdown](docs/smartHAuS_accounting-books.md) that reviews the resulting parts we bought for the project.
